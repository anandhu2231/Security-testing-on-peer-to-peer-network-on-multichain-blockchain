# Security-testing-on-peer-to-peer-network-on-multichain-blockchain

This projects explores security testing on multichain blockchain systems, revealing that nodes with lower computing capacity are more vulnerable to network-level attacks.

Setup
A multichain blockchain network was set up using various devices. Node 1 was a laptop with an i3 processor running Bodhi Linux, while Nodes 2 and 4 were Raspberry Pi 4 and 3B+ running Ubuntu Unity. Node 3 was a laptop with a powerful i7 processor running Bodhi Linux and was patched. Git and curl were installed for remote administration. A new blockchain was created on Node 1, and the chain parameters and network settings were configured on all nodes. Nodes 2, 3, and 4 were added to the network, and their connections were verified. Permissions for critical operations were enabled to ensure secure network governance.

# Multichain Setup
## Nodes and Specifications
- Node 1: Laptop with i3 processor running Bodhi Linux
- Node 2: Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Unity
- Node 3: Laptop with i7 processor running Bodhi Linux
- Node 4: Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Ubuntu Unity

## Software
- Bodhi Linux
- Ubuntu Unity
- Multichain


## Setup Instructions
* create a new blockchain : `multichain-util create chain1`
* start the chain : `multichaind chain1 -daemon`
* Configure Chain Parameter : `nano ~/.multichain/chain1/multichain.conf`
* Connect Additional Nodes (Nodes 2, 3, 4) : `multichaind chain1@<Node1_IP>:<port>`
* Verify Connections : `multichain-cli chain1 getinfo`
* Enable Permissions for Secure Network Governance : `multichain-cli chain1 grant <address> connect,send,receive`

# Attack on P2P Network

* DOS - A DoS attack overwhelms a network or service with excessive traffic, causing it to slow down or become unavailable. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the service.
* DDOS - A DDoS attack uses multiple compromised devices to flood a network or service with traffic, making it hard to stop. This results in severe disruptions and unavailability of the service.
* Eclipse Attack - An eclipse attack isolates a blockchain node by surrounding it with malicious nodes.
* Livness Attack - A liveness attack disrupts a blockchain network's ability to confirm transactions by preventing nodes from communicating effectively. This leads to delays and potential downtime.
* Transaction Flooding - Transaction flooding involves sending a large number of transactions to a blockchain network, causing congestion. This slows down processing time.
* Time Jacking - Time jacking manipulates a node's network time to disrupt transaction ordering and block validation. This can lead to inconsistent transaction processing and potential double-spending.
* Spatial Partitioning Attack - A spatial partitioning attack creates divisions within a blockchain network, isolating nodes and disrupting communication. 

# Implementation of Attack

* DOS
  - TCP Flooding : A TCP SYN flood attack overwhelms a server with numerous SYN requests, causing resource exhaustion, slowdowns, and potential server crashes due to high CPU and memory usage.
  - DNS Flooding : A DNS flood attack overwhelms a DNS server, causing delays and failures in domain name resolution, causing widespread disruptions and difficulty accessing websites and online services.

* DDOS
  - A DDoS attack occurs when two zombie nodes, controlled by a single main node, overwhelm the network with excessive requests, disrupting normal operations and potentially compromising security.
    * The same code we used on DoS is used here with running in other nodes

* Eclipse Attack
  We need to change the permission from
    * anyone-can-connect  	 :false
    * anyone-can-send	       :false
    * anyone-can-receive	   :false
    * anyone-can-create    	 :false
    * anyone-can-activate	   :false
    * anyone-can-admin	 	   :false 

   to the below:
    * anyone-can-connect  	 :true
    * anyone-can-send	       :true
    * anyone-can-receive	   :true
    * anyone-can-create    	 :true
    * anyone-can-activate	   :true
    * anyone-can-admin	 	   :true


* Livness Attack

* Transaction Flooding

* Time Jacking

* Spatial Partitioning Attack
