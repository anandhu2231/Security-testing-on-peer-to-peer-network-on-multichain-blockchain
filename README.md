# Security-testing-on-peer-to-peer-network-on-multichain-blockchain

This projects explores security testing on multichain blockchain systems, revealing that nodes with lower computing capacity are more vulnerable to network-level attacks.

Setup
A multichain blockchain network was created by installing hardware and software on various devices. Node 1 was a laptop with an i3 processor running Bodhi Linux, while Nodes 2 and 4 were Raspberry Pi 4 and Ubuntu. Node 3, with a powerful i7 processor, ran Bodhi Linux and was patched. Git and curl were installed for remote administration. A new blockchain was created on Node 1, and chain parameters and network settings were configured on each node. Nodes 2, 3, and 4 were added, and successful connections were verified. Permissions for critical operations were enabled for secure network governance.
